#   TRUFFLEHOG_RESULTS       optional trufflehog --results filter, e.g.
#                            "verified,unknown,unverified". Unset means
#                            "verified,unknown", which is what the hooks use.
#
# Why "verified,unknown" and not --only-verified (see
# AFixt/detect-features#112): trufflehog files a candidate whose verification
# could not complete (connection refused, or a verification request that
# timed out on a loaded machine) under "unknown", not "verified".
# --only-verified dropped those and exited 0, so a live secret staged on a
# busy or offline machine passed the hook as clean. A scan that could not
# decide now blocks instead. "unverified" (the provider answered and said
# no) stays excluded, as before.
#
# Ported from AFixt/shareable#191 (issue #260 here).

  #   1. It never saw staged content. trufflehog's git source scans commits,
  #      and a staged change is not a commit yet, so the range was empty and
  #      the scan passed whatever was about to be committed.
  #   2. It failed outright in a git worktree, where .git is a pointer file
  #      rather than a directory: trufflehog tries to open .git/index and
  #      errors with "not a directory", blocking every commit made there.
  #
  # Instead, write the staged version of every added, copied, modified,
  # renamed or type-changed file into a private temporary directory and scan
  # that as a filesystem. `git checkout-index` reads the index, not the working
  # tree, so this is exactly what the commit will contain (partially staged
  # files included), and plain git plumbing resolves the pointer file in a
  # worktree the same way it does everywhere else.
